# karma-growl-reporter

> Report test results using [Growl](http://growl.info/).

## Installation

**At first, make sure you have Growl for [Mac][1] / [Windows][2] / [Linux][3].**
This plugin uses [growly](https://github.com/theabraham/growly), which uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (GNTP), which was implemented in Growl since version 1.3, so you must have an appropriate version of Growl installed for this plugin to work.

The easiest way is to keep `karma-growl-reporter` as a devDependency in your `package.json`.
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "karma": "~0.10",
    "karma-growl-reporter": "~0.1"
  }
}
```

You can simple do it by:
```bash
npm install karma-growl-reporter --save-dev
```

###

## Configuration
```js
// karma.conf.js
module.exports = function(config) {
  config.set({
    reporters: ['progress', 'growl'],
  });
};
```

You can pass list of reporters as a CLI argument too:
```bash
karma start --reporters growl,dots
```

### Growl Client Configuration
The reporter publishes three notification types "Success", "Failure", and "Aborted."  You can configure your Growl client to respond differently (or not at all) to each type.  Typically the reporter must be run at least once, in order for it to register with the client, before it can be configured.
